    "text": "Getting started\nTo get started with OpenAI models in Python, you will need to install the openai library.\n!pip install openai\nAfter you have installed, you will also need to create an OpenAI API key by signing up for opena an OpenAI account. You can use this link to sign up for OpenAI account. Once you sign up you will get a free credit of $5 which you need to consume in three months. You can create secret API key by going to API key page on OpenAI platform.\nOnce you have installed the necessary libraries and created an API key, you have to load the libraries and OpenAI key. You can either hardcode the API Key or you can use an environment variable to store this.\nimport openai\nimport os\n\n# A sample value for illustration which will not work :)\n# openai.api_key  = \"sk-vuZEBvfa0UUAiGmYJPkqT3vvvvvJNhaT2TGHrJA6MdLHCxud\" \n\nopenai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')\nAfter you have Python configured and set up API key, the next step is to send request to OpenAI model using API. I have a created a helper function for simplicity.\ndef get_completion(prompt ):\n    messages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=messages,\n        temperature=0.1, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\nThis function takes a prompt (text) as input and return the response from OpenAI as output. You can test this function using any simple prompt.\nprompt = \"When Indian constitution was adopted?\"\n\noutput = get_completion(prompt)\nprint(output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\nThe Indian constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949.\n\n\nWhen you execute this, API calls goes to OpenAI with your query and OpenAI returns the output as text."

However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.\n\nThe exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain the same.\n\nFor adults\nA healthy diet includes the following:\n\nFruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).\nAt least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.\nLess than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars (2, 7), which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits (7). Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.\nLess than 30% of total energy intake from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans-fats of all kinds, including both industrially-produced trans-fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans-fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake and trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially-produced trans-fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6).\nLess than 5  g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day (8).  Salt should be iodized.\nFor infants and young children\nIn the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.\n\nAdvice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are also important:\n\nInfants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life.\nInfants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond.\nFrom 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods.\nPractical advice on maintaining a healthy diet\nFruit and vegetables\nEating at least 400 g, or five portions, of fruit and vegetables per day reduces the risk of NCDs (2) and helps to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre.\n\nFruit and vegetable intake can be improved by:\n\nalways including vegetables in meals;\neating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks;\neating fresh fruit and vegetables that are in season; and\neating a variety of fruit and vegetables.\nFats\nReducing the amount of total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy intake helps to prevent unhealthy weight gain in the adult population (1, 2, 3). Also, the risk of developing NCDs is lowered by:\n\nreducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake;\nreducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and\nreplacing both saturated fats and trans-fats with unsaturated fats (2, 3) – in particular, with polyunsaturated fats.\nFat intake, especially saturated fat and industrially-produced trans-fat intake, can be reduced by:\n\nsteaming or boiling instead of frying when cooking;\nreplacing butter, lard and ghee with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean, canola (rapeseed), corn, safflower and sunflower oils;\neating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; and\nlimiting the consumption of baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods (e.g. doughnuts, cakes, pies, cookies, biscuits and wafers) that contain industrially-produced trans-fats.\nSalt, sodium and potassium\nMost people consume too much sodium through salt (corresponding to consuming an average of 9–12 g of salt per day) and not enough potassium (less than 3.5 g). High sodium intake and insufficient potassium intake contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke (8, 11).\n\nReducing salt intake to the recommended level of less than 5 g per day could prevent 1.7 million deaths each year (12).\n\nPeople are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, most salt  comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks) or from foods consumed frequently in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to foods during cooking (e.g. bouillon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the point of consumption (e.g. table salt).\n\nSalt intake can be reduced by:\n\nlimiting the amount of salt and high-sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce, fish sauce and bouillon) when cooking and preparing foods;\nnot having salt or high-sodium sauces on the table;\nlimiting the consumption of salty snacks; and\nchoosing products with lower sodium content.\nSome food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the sodium content of their products, and people should be encouraged to check nutrition labels to see how much sodium is in a product before purchasing or consuming it.\n\nPotassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure. Intake of potassium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nSugars\nIn both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7).  A reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake would provide additional health benefits (7).\n\nConsuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (13).\n\nSugars intake can be reduced by:\n\nlimiting the consumption of foods and drinks containing high amounts of sugars, such as sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e. all types of beverages containing free sugars – these include carbonated or non‐carbonated soft drinks, fruit or vegetable juices and drinks, liquid and powder concentrates, flavoured water, energy and sports drinks, ready‐to‐drink tea, ready‐to‐drink coffee and flavoured milk drinks); and\neating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks instead of sugary snacks.\n\"\"\"\n\n\nSome text\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nSummarize the text delimited by triple backticks \\ \ninto one paragraph.\n```{text}```\n\"\"\"\nresponse = get_completion(prompt)\nprint(response)\n\nConsuming a healthy diet is important for preventing malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases. However, dietary patterns have shifted due to increased production of processed foods and changing lifestyles. People are now consuming more high-energy, fatty, sugary, and salty foods, while not eating enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The composition of a healthy diet varies based on individual characteristics, cultural context, and locally available foods. For adults, a healthy diet includes fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. It should also limit the intake of sugars and fats, particularly saturated and trans fats. Salt intake should be limited to less than 5g per day. For infants and young children, breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months and should be continued until 2 years of age. From 6 months, breast milk should be supplemented with nutrient-dense foods without added salt or sugars. Practical advice for maintaining a healthy diet includes eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, reducing fat intake, and limiting salt and sugar consumption."
