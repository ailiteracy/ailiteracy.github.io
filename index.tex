\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A comprehensive resource for Python programmers, providing in-depth
knowledge and practical skills to harness the power of OpenAI and apply
it in real-world scenarios.

This is a book created to explain how can you start working on Open AI
models using Python.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{chapter-1}{%
\chapter{Chapter 1}\label{chapter-1}}

In this chapter, we will introduce you to the basics of using OpenAI
models in Python.

We will start by installing the necessary Python libraries and creating
an OpenAI API key. Then, we will show you how to perform some basic
tasks with OpenAI models, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Text summarization
\item
  Output in a given format
\item
  Translation
\item
  Code generation
\end{itemize}

We will also provide some tips for best practices when using OpenAI
models.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\section{Getting started}\label{getting-started}}

To get started with OpenAI models in Python, you will need to install
the openai library.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{!}\NormalTok{pip install openai}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After you have installed, you will also need to create an OpenAI API key
by signing up for opena an OpenAI account. You can use this
\href{https://platform.openai.com/}{link} to sign up for OpenAI account.
Once you sign up you will get a free credit of \$5 which you need to
consume in three months. You can create secret API key by going to
\href{https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys}{API key page} on
OpenAI platform.

Once you have installed the necessary libraries and created an API key,
you have to load the libraries and OpenAI key. You can either hardcode
the API Key or you can use an environment variable to store this.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ openai}
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ os}

\CommentTok{\# A sample value for illustration which will not work :)}
\CommentTok{\# openai.api\_key  = "sk{-}vuZEBvfa0UUAiGmYJPkqT3vvvvvJNhaT2TGHrJA6MdLHCxud" }

\NormalTok{openai.api\_key  }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ os.getenv(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}OPENAI\_API\_KEY\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

After you have Python configured and set up API key, the next step is to
send request to OpenAI model using API. I have a created a helper
function for simplicity.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ get\_completion(prompt ):}
\NormalTok{    messages }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [\{}\StringTok{"role"}\NormalTok{: }\StringTok{"user"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"content"}\NormalTok{: prompt\}]}
\NormalTok{    response }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ openai.ChatCompletion.create(}
\NormalTok{        model}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{"gpt{-}3.5{-}turbo"}\NormalTok{,}
\NormalTok{        messages}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{messages,}
\NormalTok{        temperature}\OperatorTok{=}\FloatTok{0.1}\NormalTok{, }\CommentTok{\# this is the degree of randomness of the model\textquotesingle{}s output}
\NormalTok{    )}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ response.choices[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{].message[}\StringTok{"content"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This function takes a prompt (text) as input and return the response
from OpenAI as output. You can test this function using any simple
prompt.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{prompt }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"When Indian constitution was adopted?"}

\NormalTok{output }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ get\_completion(prompt)}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(output)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, coltitle=black, breakable, opacityback=0, bottomrule=.15mm, left=2mm, leftrule=.75mm, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, rightrule=.15mm, colback=white, titlerule=0mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, title={Output}, arc=.35mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, bottomtitle=1mm]

\begin{verbatim}
The Indian constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949.
\end{verbatim}

\end{tcolorbox}

When you execute this, API calls goes to OpenAI with your query and
OpenAI returns the output as text.

\StringTok{Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life{-}course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.}

\StringTok{The exact make{-}up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain the same.}

\StringTok{For adults}
\StringTok{A healthy diet includes the following:}

\StringTok{Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).}
\StringTok{At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.}
\StringTok{Less than 10}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake from free sugars (2, 7), which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming about 2000 calories per day, but ideally is less than 5}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake for additional health benefits (7). Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.}
\StringTok{Less than 30}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake from fats (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils) are preferable to saturated fats (found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard) and trans{-}fats of all kinds, including both industrially{-}produced trans{-}fats (found in baked and fried foods, and pre{-}packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, biscuits, wafers, and cooking oils and spreads) and ruminant trans{-}fats (found in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals, such as cows, sheep, goats and camels). It is suggested that the intake of saturated fats be reduced to less than 10}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake and trans{-}fats to less than 1}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially{-}produced trans{-}fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6).}
\StringTok{Less than 5  g of salt (equivalent to about one teaspoon) per day (8).  Salt should be iodized.}
\StringTok{For infants and young children}
\StringTok{In the first 2 years of a child’s life, optimal nutrition fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development. It also reduces the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.}

\StringTok{Advice on a healthy diet for infants and children is similar to that for adults, but the following elements are also important:}

\StringTok{Infants should be breastfed exclusively during the first 6 months of life.}
\StringTok{Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age and beyond.}
\StringTok{From 6 months of age, breast milk should be complemented with a variety of adequate, safe and nutrient{-}dense foods. Salt and sugars should not be added to complementary foods.}
\StringTok{Practical advice on maintaining a healthy diet}
\StringTok{Fruit and vegetables}
\StringTok{Eating at least 400 g, or five portions, of fruit and vegetables per day reduces the risk of NCDs (2) and helps to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre.}

\StringTok{Fruit and vegetable intake can be improved by:}

\StringTok{always including vegetables in meals;}
\StringTok{eating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks;}
\StringTok{eating fresh fruit and vegetables that are in season; and}
\StringTok{eating a variety of fruit and vegetables.}
\StringTok{Fats}
\StringTok{Reducing the amount of total fat intake to less than 30}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake helps to prevent unhealthy weight gain in the adult population (1, 2, 3). Also, the risk of developing NCDs is lowered by:}

\StringTok{reducing saturated fats to less than 10}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake;}
\StringTok{reducing trans{-}fats to less than 1}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake; and}
\StringTok{replacing both saturated fats and trans{-}fats with unsaturated fats (2, 3) – in particular, with polyunsaturated fats.}
\StringTok{Fat intake, especially saturated fat and industrially{-}produced trans{-}fat intake, can be reduced by:}

\StringTok{steaming or boiling instead of frying when cooking;}
\StringTok{replacing butter, lard and ghee with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean, canola (rapeseed), corn, safflower and sunflower oils;}
\StringTok{eating reduced{-}fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; and}
\StringTok{limiting the consumption of baked and fried foods, and pre{-}packaged snacks and foods (e.g. doughnuts, cakes, pies, cookies, biscuits and wafers) that contain industrially{-}produced trans{-}fats.}
\StringTok{Salt, sodium and potassium}
\StringTok{Most people consume too much sodium through salt (corresponding to consuming an average of 9–12 g of salt per day) and not enough potassium (less than 3.5 g). High sodium intake and insufficient potassium intake contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke (8, 11).}

\StringTok{Reducing salt intake to the recommended level of less than 5 g per day could prevent 1.7 million deaths each year (12).}

\StringTok{People are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, most salt  comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks) or from foods consumed frequently in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to foods during cooking (e.g. bouillon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the point of consumption (e.g. table salt).}

\StringTok{Salt intake can be reduced by:}

\StringTok{limiting the amount of salt and high{-}sodium condiments (e.g. soy sauce, fish sauce and bouillon) when cooking and preparing foods;}
\StringTok{not having salt or high{-}sodium sauces on the table;}
\StringTok{limiting the consumption of salty snacks; and}
\StringTok{choosing products with lower sodium content.}
\StringTok{Some food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the sodium content of their products, and people should be encouraged to check nutrition labels to see how much sodium is in a product before purchasing or consuming it.}

\StringTok{Potassium can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure. Intake of potassium can be increased by consuming fresh fruit and vegetables.}

\StringTok{Sugars}
\StringTok{In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake (2, 7).  A reduction to less than 5}\SpecialCharTok{\% o}\StringTok{f total energy intake would provide additional health benefits (7).}

\StringTok{Consuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (13).}

\StringTok{Sugars intake can be reduced by:}

\StringTok{limiting the consumption of foods and drinks containing high amounts of sugars, such as sugary snacks, candies and sugar{-}sweetened beverages (i.e. all types of beverages containing free sugars – these include carbonated or non‐carbonated soft drinks, fruit or vegetable juices and drinks, liquid and powder concentrates, flavoured water, energy and sports drinks, ready‐to‐drink tea, ready‐to‐drink coffee and flavoured milk drinks); and}
\StringTok{eating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks instead of sugary snacks.}

Consuming a healthy diet is important for preventing malnutrition and
noncommunicable diseases. However, dietary patterns have shifted due to
increased production of processed foods and changing lifestyles. People
are now consuming more high-energy, fatty, sugary, and salty foods,
while not eating enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The
composition of a healthy diet varies based on individual
characteristics, cultural context, and locally available foods. For
adults, a healthy diet includes fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and
whole grains. It should also limit the intake of sugars and fats,
particularly saturated and trans fats. Salt intake should be limited to
less than 5g per day. For infants and young children, breastfeeding is
recommended for the first 6 months and should be continued until 2 years
of age. From 6 months, breast milk should be supplemented with
nutrient-dense foods without added salt or sugars. Practical advice for
maintaining a healthy diet includes eating a variety of fruits and
vegetables, reducing fat intake, and limiting salt and sugar
consumption.

The OpenAI model has returned the output in a json string format. We can
play with this string and create a json object . In the last we can
create a data frame using the json object.

In this chapter, we saw how to start working with OpenAI GPT models
using API. In the next chapter we'll see how to work with system prompt.

\hypertarget{chapter-2}{%
\chapter{Chapter 2}\label{chapter-2}}

In this chapter, we will see the

\begin{itemize}
\item
  structure of helper function and
\item
  output of openai.ChatCompletion
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structure-of-helper-function}{%
\section{Structure of helper
function}\label{structure-of-helper-function}}

In the last chapter, we have used a pre-defined helper function to send
request to OpenAI and get response.

\includegraphics{1_open_ai_helper_function.drawio.png}

\begin{verbatim}
Warning: package 'gt' was built under R version 4.3.1

\hypertarget{understanding-the-response-object}{%
\section{Understanding the response
object}\label{understanding-the-response-object}}

In the previous, section we saw the elements of helper function. When we
call OpenAI ChatCompletion, we get their response as response object.
Lets see the components of response.

We'll modify the helper function, where we'll see the response object
directly to calling function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Modified helper function}
\KeywordTok{def}\NormalTok{ get\_completion(prompt):}
\NormalTok{    messages }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ [\{}\StringTok{"role"}\NormalTok{: }\StringTok{"user"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"content"}\NormalTok{: prompt\}]}

\NormalTok{    )}
    \ControlFlowTok{return}\NormalTok{ response}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{prompt }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"Who discovered the laws of motion"}
\NormalTok{response }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ get\_completion(prompt)}
\BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(response)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Output}:

\includegraphics{images/ch2/2_response_object.png}

As, you can see above, the output of OpenAI ChatCompletion is a json
object. Few keys are self explanatory, we can skip those and understand
others by breaking into small parts.

\hypertarget{choices}{%
\subsubsection{Choices}\label{choices}}

ChatCompletion.create function from OpenAI returns a response object
like above.. In order to understand better, we'll break it and see
output step wise.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{response.choices}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Output}:

\includegraphics{images/ch2/2_1_response_object.png}

This command will extract the choices from response which is a list of
JSON. This list has only elements with JSON format. It has three keys
index, message and finish\_reason.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{response.choices[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{images/ch2/2_2_response_object.png}

Since, response.choices is a list with one element, this statement below
👇🏾 fetch the the first element from the list which is a json.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{response.choices[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{].message}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Output}:

\includegraphics{images/ch2/2_3_response_object.png}

The \textbf{message} json has two elements, role and content which we
generally use while bulding AI applications.

Finally, we'll use this statement to fetch the response from OpenAI
ChatCompletion.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{response.choices[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{].message[}\StringTok{"content"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{get-usage-data}{%
\subsubsection{Get Usage data}\label{get-usage-data}}

Many times, there are requirement from business to keep track of total
token usages. We can use the same response object to fetch token.

If you see the content of response, 👇🏾👇🏾, it has another key usage.

\includegraphics{images/ch2/2_response_object.png}

We can extract usage using.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{response.usage}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OperatorTok{\textless{}}\NormalTok{OpenAIObject at }\BaseNTok{0x22ea8fcf950}\OperatorTok{\textgreater{}}\NormalTok{ JSON: \{}

  \StringTok{"completion\_tokens"}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{11}\NormalTok{,}
  \StringTok{"total\_tokens"}\NormalTok{: }\DecValTok{24}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It has three keys \textbf{prompt\_tokens}, \textbf{completion\_tokens},
\textbf{total\_tokens.}

To track the use of tokens, you can use

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{response.usage[}\StringTok{"total\_tokens"}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%

In this chapter, we discussed the structure of helper function we
created and OpenAI's ChatCompletion.
